- Description 

Pengo is a classic arcade game set in a frosty, icy maze where players take control of Pengo, a determined penguin who must navigate a series of icy environments to eliminate enemies known as Sno-Bees. The goal is to clear each stage by either crushing Sno-Bees with blocks of ice or trapping them in the ice blocks, while avoiding their attacks. The game features a unique blend of action and puzzle-solving, requiring both quick reflexes and strategic thinking.
